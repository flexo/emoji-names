# emoji_names.pl

An irssi script to convert emoji in incoming messages to their plain text equivalents

```
<Flexo> because sometimes tmux and/or mosh just won't cooperate with me :face with tears of joy:
```

# Usage

Place emoji_names.pl in .irssi/scripts/, then in irssi, run 

```
/script load emoji_names.pl
```

## TODO

* customise the surrounding characters (currently ":")
* customise the word joiner within emoji names (currently space)
* Maybe do outgoing emoji too! (Probably more useful?)
